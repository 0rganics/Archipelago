# Secret of Evermore

## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game
is always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before
they would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?
All gourds/chests/pots, boss drops and alchemists are shuffled. Additionally you may choose to also shuffle alchemy
ingredients, sniff spot items, call bead spells and the dog.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to
limit certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in Secret of Evermore?
Secret of Evermore will just display "Sent an Item". Check the client output if you want to know which.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
When the player receives an item, a borderless text will appear to show which item was received. You can not receive
items while a script is active, for example in Nobilia Market or during most Boss Fights. You will receive the items
once no more scripts are running.
